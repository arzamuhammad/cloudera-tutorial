# CPU vs GPU Performance Comparisons

Explore how you can leverage NVIDIA's RAPIDS framework. See significant speed improvements compared to commonly used machine learning libraries such as pandas, NumPy and Sklearn in both data preprocessing and model training.

Modify variable **mode** in Jupyter notebook to run code using CPU or GPU:

- **mode = *'cpu'***, runs code using CPU
- **mode = *'gpu'***, runs code using GPU
