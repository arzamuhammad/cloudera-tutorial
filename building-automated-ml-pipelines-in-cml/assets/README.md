## Productionized Data Science
## EV Part Forecasting

In order to most efficiently operate our factories, we need to be able to accurately
forecast what parts are going to be needed in the future. To do this, we rely on previous
data in order to create models that accurately estimate how many of each component may be
needed in the given time range. This way factories can tweak their production accordingly and not
run either a part shortage or surplus. We will focus on one specific part, the vehicle motors.
