# Building Automated ML Pipelines in Cloudera Machine Learning

Data Lifecycle - Predictive Analytics. Using synthetic datasets for an electric car company, we will predict the amount of inventory that may be required for a specific part based on historical part consumption. We will create a pipeline that when new data is collected, it will automatically predict inventory needed for seven (7), fourteen (14) and twenty-one (21) days.
